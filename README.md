```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have `ffmpeg` and `python3` installed. For interactive features (remote control/clipboard), install `xdotool` and `xclip`.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg xdotool xclip python3-venv
```

### 2. Run the Server
Clone this repository and run the startup script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krsatyam36/screenshare.git
cd screenshare
./start.sh
```

The script will automatically set up a virtual environment and install necessary Python packages.

### 3. Connect
Open the URL printed in your terminal (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10:8766`) on your tablet's browser. If you have `qrcode` installed, you can just scan the QR code printed in the terminal.

## 📦 Installation Options

### As a System Command
You can link the `screenshare` wrapper to your path:
```bash
sudo ln -sf $(pwd)/screenshare /usr/local/bin/screenshare
```
Now you can start streaming by simply typing `screenshare` from any directory.

### Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)
A pre-built package is available for easier installation:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i screen-share-tab_1.0.0_amd64.deb
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The tool is configured to detect two screens by default. If your layout is different, you can customize the `SCREENS` and `SCREEN_BOUNDS` dictionaries in `server.py`:

```python
SCREENS = {
    'laptop':   {'size': '1920x1080', 'offset': '0,1080'},
    'external': {'size': '1920x1080', 'offset': '0,0'},
}
```
*Tip: Run `xrandr` in your terminal to see your exact screen dimensions and offsets.*

## ⌨️ Browser Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|:---:|---|
| `1` / `2` | Switch to Laptop / External monitor |
| `B` | View both monitors side-by-side |
| `F` | Toggle Fullscreen |
| `←` / `→` | Swipe/Switch between screens |
| `↑` / `↓` | Adjust FPS |
| `L` / `M` / `H` | Quality: Low (600k), Medium (1.5M), High (3M) |
| `C` | Toggle Cursor Highlight |

---

## 🛡️ Security & Ports

The tool uses two ports:
- **8765**: WebSocket (Video Data)
- **8766**: HTTP (Web Interface & Remote Input)

Ensure these are allowed through your firewall:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8765/tcp
sudo ufw allow 8766/tcp
```

*Note: This tool is intended for use on trusted local networks. It does not include built-in authentication.*
